This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Device Management System

This is a React-based application for managing devices, calculating their daily, weekly, and monthly costs based on power usage. The system allows users to add new devices, update their power consumption and usage hours, and view the associated cost calculations.

# Energy Usage Manager üìä‚ö°

Welcome to the **Energy Usage Manager**!  
This application is designed to help users track energy consumption for their household devices, calculate costs, and make informed decisions to optimize power usage. By simply entering device details and usage hours, you can get an instant breakdown of daily, weekly, and monthly costs.

---

## üåü Features

- **Add and Manage Devices**: Easily add, update, or delete devices from the tracking list.
- **Real-Time Cost Calculations**: See immediate updates to costs as you adjust daily usage hours.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimalistic and responsive design for an intuitive experience.
- **Detailed Insights**: Breakdowns of energy usage and costs by day, week, and month.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

The system leverages the following technologies for a seamless user experience and robust backend:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data Handling**: SWR for efficient server synchronization
- **Alerts**: SweetAlert2 for interactive notifications

---

## üìä Cost Calculation Overview

The application calculates energy costs using the following formulas:

1. **Daily Cost**:  
   \[
   \text{Daily Cost} = \text{Power (W)} \times \text{Daily Usage Hours} \times 0.001 \times \text{Electricity Rate (‚Ç™/kWh)}
   \]

2. **Weekly Cost**:  
   \[
   \text{Weekly Cost} = \text{Daily Cost} \times 7
   \]

3. **Monthly Cost**:  
   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = \text{Daily Cost} \times 30
   \]

- **Electricity Rate** is configurable via environment variables and defaults to **0.5 ‚Ç™/kWh**.
